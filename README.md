# GM4D
Graphical Manager For DHCP

This is part of my final year project for B.Sc. of the Information and Communication Technology course at Southampton Solent Univerity.
GM4D is a tool with GUI to create and manage a DHCP Server on an Ubuntu Linux system. It is written in C# with the open source implementation of the .Net framework from the Mono Project http://www.mono-project.com/.
